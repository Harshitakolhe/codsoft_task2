CODSOFT INTERNSHIP LEVEL 1 TASK 2

NAME:-HARSHITA MANISH KOLHE

DOMAIN:-WEB DEVELOPMENT

DURATION:-1 MONTH

I have designed and built my own portfolio website from scratch. I created a clean, modern layout with sections like About Me, Skills, Projects, Resume, and Contact. I used HTML for the structure and CSS for styling, adding a fixed navigation bar and smooth scrolling for a better user experience. I also integrated some simple animations with AOS to make the content appear gracefully as you scroll. This project allowed me to showcase my web development skills and personal style in a professional way.
